#2015-09-30 Notes on statistical methods to use for analysis of photoquadrat data

#Two types of analysis: Overall and specific benthic cover category. 
#First requires Multivariate route, e.g. MANOVA or NMDS, second Univariate, e.g. ANOVA.
#e.g. Hypothesis: Coral cover is higher in 5m than in 15m depth
#Univariate, if e.g. hypothesis is Cover is significantly different in 15 than 5m as a whole a multivariate analysis, like, a MONOVA is required, or NMDS to test the grouping of sites.

#For the report Univariate will mostly be used to comapre specific categories:
#(STATS - what statistical test?: 
# Data distribution: If normal Use Bartletts, if non normal use Levene, if non-parametric: Fligner-Kileen test, to test test of homogeneity of variance: 
#If yes, then annova, if not transform data and test again, or use Kruskal-Wallis. 
#If results significantly different (p value < 0.05), then run post hoc. 
#If Annova, then Tukey's HSD test, if Kruskal-Wallis, then Games Howell)
